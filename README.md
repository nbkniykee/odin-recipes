- The current project is to showcase the knowledge i have learned so far.
The task is to build a basic recipe website.
I will revisit the project in the future to style it up with CSS.
My challange is to incorparate the following elements:
- paragraphs
- headings
- bold text
- italicized text
- html comments
- ol / ul lists
- links (absolute/relative)
- images
- I will revisit the README file after the project is finished to reflect on it again.
